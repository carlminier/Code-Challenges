Implement a function called countUniqueValues, which accepts a sorted array, and counts the unique value in the array.
There can be negative numbers in the array, but it will always be sorted.


function countUniqueValues(){
  

}
 

countUniqueValues([1,1,1,1,1,2]) //2
//countUniqueValues([1,2,3,4,4,4,7,7,12,12,13]) //7
//countUniqueValues([]) //0
//countUniqueValues([-2,-1,-1,0,1]) //4
  
//Pseudo code & thoughts
//no need to sort since array is always sorted.
//Create 2 separated for loops
//first for loop goes through each index and checks if current index is bigger than the next index
//If index is bigger, then second for loop will take the bigger number and replace the smaller number in array
//once the biggest number in array is reached, get length of array + 1 from second for loop
