Implement a function called countUniqueValues, which accepts a sorted array, and counts the unique value in the array.
There can be negative numbers in the array, but it will always be sorted.


function countUniqueValues(numArr){
    if(numArr.length === 0) return 0;
  let i = 0;
  for(let j = 1; j < numArr.length; j++){
    if(numArr[i] !== numArr[j]){
      i++  
      numArr[i] = numArr[j];
    }
  }
    return i + 1
}

countUniqueValues([1,2,3,4,5,5,6,7,8,8]) //8
//countUniqueValues([1,2,3,4,4,4,7,7,12,12,13]) //7
//countUniqueValues([]) //0
//countUniqueValues([-2,-1,-1,0,1]) //4
  
//Pseudo code & thoughts
//no need to sort since array is always sorted.
//Create 2 separated for loops
//first for loop goes through each index and checks if current index is bigger than the next index
//If index is bigger, then second for loop will take the bigger number and replace the smaller number in array
//once the biggest number in array is reached, get length of array + 1 from second for loop
